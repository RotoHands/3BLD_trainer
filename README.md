# 3BLD_trainer
#### the trainer helps drilling 3style algs, insted of solving the cube each time when you misexecute an alg, you use your smart cube as a "remote" and the virtual cube get reseted between algs (insted of solving the cube each time)
#### supports gan356i and rubiksConnected(GoCube) - no major implementation for other cubes is needed
#### change the MAC address given in trainer.py, and change the key to decryption (look at extended_translate.py - translate of Cstimer decryption from JS to python)
#### direct  implementation will be probably hard, but feel free to send me question about it!
